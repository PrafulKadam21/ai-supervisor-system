## ‚úÖ End-to-End Flow Test

This is the most important test - the complete user journey.

### Setup
1. Terminal 1: `python main.py supervisor`
2. Terminal 2: `python simple_agent.py`
3. Browser: http://localhost:5000

### Flow Steps

#### Step 1: Agent Escalates
- [ ] In agent terminal, type: "Do you have gift certificates?"
- [ ] AI escalates (says will check with manager)
- [ ] Console shows escalation notification
- [ ] Request ID is printed

#### Step 2: Supervisor Sees Request
- [ ] Refresh dashboard (or wait for auto-refresh)
- [ ] New request appears in "Pending Requests" tab
- [ ] Pending count increases in stats
- [ ] Request shows correct question
- [ ] Caller phone number is displayed

#### Step 3: Supervisor Responds
- [ ] Click to expand request
- [ ] Fill in your name: "Manager"
- [ ] Fill in answer: "Yes, we offer gift certificates starting at $25"
- [ ] Click "Submit Answer"
- [ ] Success message appears

#### Step 4: System Updates
- [ ] Console shows SMS notification to caller
- [ ] Request moves from pending to resolved
- [ ] Pending count decreases
- [ ] Resolved count increases

#### Step 5: Knowledge Base Updates
- [ ] Go to "Learned Knowledge" tab
- [ ] New entry appears for gift certificates
- [ ] Entry shows usage count of 0
- [ ] Source is "supervisor"

#### Step 6: AI Uses New Knowledge
- [ ] In agent terminal, type "new" (new call)
- [ ] Type: "Do you have gift certificates?"
- [ ] AI now answers directly with learned information
- [ ] No escalation this time
- [ ] Response includes "$25" detail

#### Step 7: Knowledge Usage Tracked
- [ ] Refresh "Learned Knowledge" tab
- [ ] Usage count for gift certificates is now 1
- [ ] Knowledge entry shows update time

## üéâ Ready to Submit!

If all checkboxes are checked, you're ready to submit. Great work!

## üìù If Something Fails

### Debugging Steps

1. **Check logs**: Look at console output carefully
2. **Check Firebase**: Verify data in Firebase Console
3. **Check API keys**: Ensure they're correct in `.env`
4. **Check dependencies**: Run `pip list` to verify installations
5. **Check Python version**: Must be 3.9+
6. **Restart**: Stop all services and start fresh
7. **Reseed**: Run `python main.py seed` again

### Common Issues

**"Firebase connection failed"**
- Check firebase_config.json path
- Verify Firestore is enabled
- Check Firebase console for errors

**"Groq API failed"**
- Verify API key is correct
- Check you have credits
- Try different model name

**"Module not found"**
- Activate virtual environment
- Reinstall requirements
- Check Python path

**"Port already in use"**
- Change SUPERVISOR_PORT in .env
- Kill process using port 5000
- Use different port

### Getting Help

If stuck:
1. Review error messages carefully
2. Check QUICKSTART.md
3. Review relevant code files
4. Test components individually
5. Check Firebase/Groq console logs
