# Quick Start Guide - 10 Minutes to Running System

Get from zero to a fully working AI supervisor system in about 10 minutes.

## ‚ö° Super Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set Up Firebase (2 minutes)

1. Go to https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Click "Add project" ‚Üí Name it "frontdesk-ai-test"
3. Disable Google Analytics (not needed)
4. Click "Create Firestore Database" ‚Üí Start in test mode ‚Üí Choose location
5. Go to Project Settings (‚öôÔ∏è) ‚Üí Service Accounts
6. Click "Generate new private key"
7. Save as `firebase_config.json` in your project folder

### 3. Get Groq API Key (1 minute)

1. Go to https://console.groq.com/
2. Sign up (free)
3. Click "API Keys" ‚Üí "Create API Key"
4. Copy the key

### 4. Create .env File (1 minute)

Create `.env` file in project root:

```bash
# Required
GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_your_actual_key_here
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=./firebase_config.json

# Optional (defaults work fine)
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=test-secret-key
SUPERVISOR_PORT=5000
BUSINESS_NAME=Luxe Hair Salon
BUSINESS_HOURS=Mon-Sat 9AM-7PM

# LiveKit (optional - only needed for voice calls)
LIVEKIT_URL=wss://placeholder.livekit.cloud
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=placeholder
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=placeholder
```

### 5. Seed Data and Test (1 minute)

```bash
# Add initial knowledge
python main.py seed

# Test connections
python main.py test
```

You should see all green checkmarks! ‚úÖ

## üéÆ Running the System

### Method 1: Text-Based Agent (Recommended)

**Terminal 1** - Start Supervisor Dashboard:
```bash
python main.py supervisor
```
Visit: http://localhost:5000

**Terminal 2** - Start Test Agent:
```bash
python simple_agent.py
```

This gives you an interactive chat to test with! Try:
- "What are your hours?" (AI will answer)
- "Do you offer wedding packages?" (AI will escalate)
- "new" to start new call
- "quit" to exit

**Terminal 3** - Or Run Automated Tests:
```bash
python simple_agent.py test
```

### Option B: Full LiveKit Integration (Advanced)

Only do this if you want real voice calls:

1. Get LiveKit credentials from https://cloud.livekit.io/
2. Update `.env` with real credentials
3. Run: `python main.py agent`

## üìù Testing the Full Flow

### Test Scenario 1: AI Answers Question

1. **Start both services** (supervisor + simple_agent)
2. **In simple_agent terminal**, type: "What are your hours?"
3. **AI responds** with business hours immediately
4. ‚úÖ Success - no escalation needed

### Test Scenario 2: AI Escalates to Supervisor

1. **In simple_agent terminal**, type: "Do you offer senior discounts?"
2. **AI escalates** - you'll see notification in console
3. **Open dashboard** at http://localhost:5000
4. **View pending request** in "Pending Requests" tab
5. **Click to expand** the request
6. **Fill in**:
   - Your Name: "Manager"
   - Answer: "Yes, we offer 15% senior discount for ages 65+"
7. **Click "Submit Answer"**
8. **Check console** - you'll see simulated SMS to caller
9. **Check "Learned Knowledge" tab** - new entry added!
10. ‚úÖ Success - complete flow

### Test Scenario 3: AI Uses Learned Knowledge

1. **In simple_agent terminal**, type "new" for new call
2. **Type**: "Do you offer senior discounts?"
3. **AI now answers** using the learned knowledge!
4. ‚úÖ Success - AI learned and improved

## üéØ What to Demo in Your Video

### Part 1: System Overview (2 min)
- Show project structure
- Explain architecture (Database ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Agent/Dashboard)
- Show the three-state lifecycle diagram

### Part 2: Live Demo (3 min)
Screen record:
1. Both terminals running
2. Ask question AI knows ‚Üí immediate answer
3. Ask question AI doesn't know ‚Üí escalation
4. Switch to dashboard ‚Üí pending request appears
5. Submit answer ‚Üí SMS notification
6. Switch to Knowledge tab ‚Üí new entry
7. New call with same question ‚Üí AI answers correctly

### Part 3: Code Walkthrough (3 min)
Show and explain:
- `database/models.py` - clean data models
- `services/help_request_service.py` - lifecycle management
- `agent/knowledge_base.py` - learning mechanism
- `supervisor/routes.py` - API design

### Part 4: Design Decisions (2 min)
Discuss:
- Why Firebase (fast to start, scales to 1000/day)
- How to scale to 10k/day (PostgreSQL, Redis, queues)
- Request lifecycle design
- Knowledge base search strategy
- Modular architecture benefits

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Firebase connection failed"
- Check `firebase_config.json` exists
- Check Firebase credentials path in `.env`
- Verify Firestore is enabled in Firebase console

### "Groq API connection failed"
- Check API key in `.env`
- Verify key is active in Groq console
- Check you have API credits (free tier available)

### "Module not found"
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Make sure you're in project directory
- Check Python version (3.9+)

### Dashboard won't load
- Check port 5000 isn't in use
- Try different port: `SUPERVISOR_PORT=5001 python main.py supervisor`
- Check Flask is installed

### Agent not escalating
- Check Groq API is working (`python main.py test`)
- Verify knowledge base has initial data (`python main.py seed`)
- Try asking more specific/unusual questions

## üìä Checking Your Data

### View Firebase Data
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Click "Firestore Database"
3. You should see collections:
   - `help_requests`
   - `knowledge_base`
   - `call_logs`

### Check Stats
Visit dashboard: http://localhost:5001
- Pending Requests count
- Resolved count
- Learned Answers count
- Average response time

## üöÄ Next Steps

Once basic system works:

1. **Customize business info** in `.env`
2. **Add more initial knowledge** in `main.py` seed function
3. **Test edge cases** - what breaks the system?
4. **Set up LiveKit** for real voice calls
5. **Add authentication** to supervisor dashboard
6. **Deploy to cloud** (Heroku, AWS, GCP)

## üí° Pro Tips

### Faster Testing
Create alias in terminal:
```bash
alias fdsup="python main.py supervisor"
alias fdagent="python simple_agent.py"
alias fdtest="python simple_agent.py test"
```

### Reset Database
If you want to start fresh:
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Delete all collections
3. Run `python main.py seed` again

### Quick Knowledge Addition
Directly add to Firebase console for testing:
1. Go to `knowledge_base` collection
2. Click "Add Document"
3. Fill in question/answer fields

### Monitor in Real-Time
Keep dashboard open while testing - it auto-refreshes every 5 seconds!

## üìπ Recording Your Demo

### Recommended Setup
1. Screen size: 1920x1080
2. Use OBS Studio or QuickTime (free)
3. Show terminal + browser side by side
4. Speak clearly, explain as you demo
5. 8-10 minutes total is perfect
